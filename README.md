# ColorBlindSaver

I am color blinded -- always wanted a program that can help me identify what the hell this color actually is.  
And here it is: the Color Blind Saver  
  
Jan 28, 2019: iOS implementation of image select from library + RGB representation of touch point
Jan 30, 2019: Enable camera picture taking (need testing); Add color name database  
now show color name according to nearest neighbour (brute force implementation tho)  
possible improvement: k-d tree  
TODO: AR; RGB to closest named color runtime improvement; UI design  
Note: opencv file too large --  not included (if needed)
